### What does bailey do

### How do they fit together

### Whats in the database and what do we use it for currently




### Layout
    You will want to make a laymans version of several things:
    
    A flowchart showing how everything connects in enough detail to be able to open the file tree up and start poking around 
    and not be lost
    
    A file tree that shows where all of those nodes on the flowchart are located
    
### Ethos
    dont be afraid to break code
    learn how to make a branch and do a merge on git
    use this style when writing (styling guide from the factor model repo)
    
    
### How to start writing
    link to a git guide
    link to downloading vscode
    link to the github
    link to the AWS console 
    who to email to get AWS access
    bullet list of what the AWS services are  ex:
        cloud9 - online coding environment
        s3 - cloud hosted hard drive
        sagemaker - cloud hosted containers to train your models in 
        ...
    
    to edit these docs
