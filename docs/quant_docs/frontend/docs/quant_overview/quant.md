## Our Mission:
To support the Student Managed Investment Fund's Portfolio through innovative quantitative research and math-driven
risk management 

### How We Do It: 
- Our work can be broken down into 3 different groups:
    1. Factor Model  
        - The Factor Model team uses machine learning algorithms and large amounts of market 
        data to help us forecast the future movements of the market. 
    2. Development/Front End  
        - The Development and Front-End teams maintain and improve our web and coding infrastructure. 
        They make sure all the other teams can function smoothly. They also upkeep the Bailey, which is how the 
        Equity side interfaces with the resources provided by Quant.
    3. Risk/Asset Management  
        - Risk and Asset Allocation teams focus on upkeeping the Risk Screen and develop new projects to improve the ease of use, 
        efficiency, and effectiveness of the code that monitors out assets. 

- The majority of our modeling and analysis happens within Python using the Cloud9 development environment.
 We interface with our AWS Postgres databases through our many custom APIs.
- Our models often utilize cutting edge methodology: machine learning, cloud computing, and complex data modeling. 


## Our Team: 

We are a group of "mathematicians", "computer scientists", "data scientists", "engineers", and "quants".
