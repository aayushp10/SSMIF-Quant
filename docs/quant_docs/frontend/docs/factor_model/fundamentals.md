## The Three Segments of Data
- Valuation
- Sentiment
- Cash Inflows and Outflows

Importantly, we call them those names becuase those are the most descriptive terms we could come up with. Valuation contains fundamental data from the individual sector ETFs, Sentiment is any measure that can be used to approximate how people are feeling about the sector (bullish - bearish), and Cash Inflows and Outflows are self-descriptive

### Valuation
- #### P/E
    - Price to equity ratio. This is used to measure a securities current share price relative to its per share earnings. Changes in this ratio per sector are used to determine whether or not a sectro is becoming increasingly overvalued or undervalued in the market. 
- #### P/B
    - Price to book ratio compares market capitalization to book value. A P/B rato shifting from under 1 to over 1 may indicate a decrease in the overall safety of a sector, and a decrease in its book value.  
- #### P/S
    - Price to sales ratio, take a company's market capitalization (num outstanding shares * market price) and divide by total sales or revenue over the past 12 months. This is a useful replacement for P/E in sectors where earinigns are cyclical (like those with heavy semiconductor allocations). This is useful for spotting recovery situations and double checking that an asset is not overvalued by the market.  low P/S is good news while a very high one can be a warning sign
- #### Free Cash Flow Yield + Earnings Yield
    - These two metrics realate a company's financial prositon realtive to its current share price (what the market feels the firm is worth). FCFY measures solvency whereas Earnings Yield measures how a company's earnings measure up relative to their valuation
- #### Total Debt / Total Assets
    - Given the SSMIF's long term investment horizon, it is important to know if a sector is showing signs of financial distress before investing in it. Using TOTD/TOTA, we can measrue how much of a sectors health is supported by borrowing versus operations, and use changes in this factor as a way of understanding the sector's performance moving forward. Ex: increases in this ratio suggest that a sectors overall performance is falling, and that company valuations will begin to decrease as well 

### Sentiment
- #### Put Call Ratio
    - This ratio is used to gauage the overall mood of the market with regards to a certain security. Shifting in this indicator can reveal bearish or bullish sentiment on a security. An increase in this ratio signals bearish sentiment, a decrease in this ratio signals bullish sentiment
- #### Volume
    - Volume refers to the amount of trades a security is experiencing. Looking at cahnage in volume over time can give our factor model the ability to discern the conviction behind movements in the market. Ex: if markets are rising and volume is increasing accordingly, it signals that this is not a rise caused by volatility, but rather a strong and healthy rise
- #### Institutional Ownership
    - A metric which helps us track how "smart money" feels about a cerain security i.e which percentage of the company's available stock is owned by mutual or pension funds, insurance companies, private foundations, endowments, or other large entitiies that manage funds on behaf of others. Should we see a sharp rise in the Institutional ownership of a security, it may indicate that it is a good time to buy into it, as mutual funds tend to do everythng in their power to drive up the price of a security they have entered into a long position on

### Macro
- #### GDP Growth
    - A solid metric of how the economy as a whole is doing over time. This metric is good for signaling shifts in the market
- #### 2y & 10y Treasury Bond Yields 
    - High short term treasury yields indicate low 2y bond prices, which indicates that there is not a lot of demand for short term govt bonds becuase the stock market will lead to more short term return. When the 2y yield drops it is because investors are buying into the bonds to escape the market, signaling a loss of confidence. The 10 year bond works much the same way, and is viewed as a captial save haven in troubled times. 
- #### Unemployment Rate and Labor Force Participation Rate
    - A dropping unemployment rate generally signals a move towards higher productivity in the economy, and is correlated with higher stock price [a nice chart](https://cabotwealth.com/daily/stock-market/unemployment-stock-market-correlation-one-chart/). The LFPR information suppliements the Unemployment Rate information for a theoretically more robust prediction.
- #### Inflation
    - Value stocks have been shown to perform better in high inflation periods, while growth stocks perform better in periods of low inflation. When inflation is on the upswing, high-dividend-paying stock prices generally decline. Stocks overall seem to be more volatile during highly inflationary periods.

## Mutual Fund Inflow and Outflow Data

### Why Do We Want It and What Have We Done About It
- We want it becuase when Goldman first pitched the absolute foundation of the Factor Model input factors they thought it would be a good idea. It is one of the most robust metrics for analyzing the flow of "smart money" through the market, and tracing it would give us an edge over our competitors. We can essentially "follow the money." We are currently attempting to proxy this data by using our existing three Sentiment factors, however, they are no replacement for the real thing. 

### Where We Can Get It
- Morningstar: specifically the <b>Advanced Morningstar Advisor Workstation</b> subscription. Accounting for taxes and fees, we would request $5,000 annually to cover the data cost. The base subscription fee is $4,000 annually. The subscription information was obtained after a series of conversations with Katherine Gannon last semester
